### Why Bedrock Proxy Endpoint?

Are you are stuck with using AWS Bedrock for all LLM text inference, but you want to keep your application platform agnostic?  Are you tired of figuring out how to format your LLM inference calls to work with the Bedrock SDK? Are you going crazy with all the differences between configuration from model to model?

- `Bedrock Proxy Endpoint` makes it easy to continue using the OpenAI API client that you are use to by standing up your own OpenAI text compatible endpoint that will proxy all your calls to Bedrock in a compatible way.

- Great for getting existing OpenAI API compatible applications working with AWS Bedrock.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jparkerweb/bedrock-proxy-endpoint.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd bedrock-proxy-endpoint
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

### Configuration

* Update the `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following
  environment variables based on your desired configuration:

    | key                        | value type | example                   | notes                          |
    |----------------------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
    | CONSOLE_LOGGING            | boolean    | false                     | Show realtime logs             |
    | HTTP_ENABLED               | boolean    | true                      | Start a HTTP server            |
    | HTTP_PORT                  | integer    | 80                        | HTTP server port               |
    | HTTPS_ENABLED              | boolean    | false                     | Start a HTTPS server           |
    | HTTPS_PORT                 | integer    | 443                       | HTTPS server port              |
    | HTTPS_KEY_PATH             | string     | ./path/mykey.key          | Path to key file for HTTPS     |
    | HTTPS_CERT_PATH            | string     | ./path/mycert.pem         | Path to cert file for HTTPS    |
    | IP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED      | boolean    | true                      | Enable rate limiting by IP     |
    | IP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS    | integer    | 60000                     | Window in milliseconds         |
    | IP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS | integer    | 100                       | Max requests per IP per window |

### Authentication

`Bedrock Proxy` authenticates with AWS via `IAM`. Since the OpenAI API intance accpets an API Key we will utilize this value to hold your credentials. Construct your `apiKey` for inference in the next step following this format:

- `AWS_REGION` + `.` + `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `.` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- example `apiKey` value:  
  `us-west-2.AKIAWSGBPOAB34JZUEPP.ySssDeZBXGab+eqeaAxblSL+iEc/CS8Ff1HW3VV7`

---

### Usage

- Start the server via: `node server`  

  <img src="docs/console.png">  

  You are now ready to make a standard chat completions to the server.

- Important values
  - `baseUrl`: Root address of server based on your `.env` configuration.
  - `apiKey`: Descibed in the *Authentication* section above.
  - `messages`: Array of objects in role / content format.
  - `model`: This can be either the `modelName` or `modelId` from the list of supported models found on the `Bedrock Wrapper` README file [here](https://github.com/jparkerweb/bedrock-wrapper?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models); The `/models` enpoint of this server will also return a list of supported models.

### Example OpenAI API Call

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const messages = [
    {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful AI assistant that follows instructions extremely well. Answer the user questions accurately.",
    },
    {
        role: "user",
        content: "Describe why the OpenAI API standard is so great. Limit your response to five sentences.",
    },
    {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "",
    },
];

const baseURL = "http://localhost";
// this is only an example apiKey
const apiKey = "us-west-2.AKIAWSGBPOAB34JZUEPP.ySssDeZBXGab+eqeaAxblSL+iEc/CS8Ff1HW3VV7"

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: baseURL,
    apiKey: apiKey,
});
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: messages,
    model: "Claude-3-5-Sonnet-v2",
    max_tokens: 800,
    temperature: 0.4,
    top_p: 0.7,
    stream: true,
})

for await (const chunk of chatCompletion) {
    const response = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
    process.stdout.write(response);
}
```

### Note

Alternativly you can incorporate ü™® <a href="https://github.com/jparkerweb/bedrock-wrapper" target="bedrockWrapper">`Bedrock Wrapper`</a> core directly into your code base. If you would like to explore that option checkout the npm package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bedrock-wrapper
